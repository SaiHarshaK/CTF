# A Kludge of CTF Resources
Resources for CTFs including articles, guides, scripts, and hints/ solutions to some CTF challenges.

# Motivation
This repository is being developed to help those beginning CTFs. These resources were initially intended for the newer members of Kludge -- the InfoSec Club of IIT Hyderabad. This was started as a project in the Summer of 2018.

## What are CTFs?
CTFs are computer security/hacking competitions which generally consist of participants breaking, investigating, reverse engineering and doing anything they can to reach the end goal, a "flag" which is usually found as a string of text.Finding this flag is proof that you solved the puzzle, and submitting it to the scoreboard earns your team points.Flags are very distinctive so they are easy to find if you do come across one.

A CTF requires contestants to integrate concepts, develop skills and learn to hack as they go. They are usually a model of real-world security situations all sorts of computer security problems and to succeed, one must demonstrate a profound understanding of the roles and ramifications of cyber security in these situations.
